# Interactive fiction resources

This is a collection of general interactive fiction resources, which
currently consists of a MIME type database for interactive fiction game
files. The MIME type database corresponds to the freedesktop.org
[shared-mime-info specification](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/shared-mime-info-spec/).

To install the MIME type database, copy interactive-fiction.xml to
/usr/share/mime/packages, and (as root) run:

```
update-mime-database /usr/share/mime
```
